This started has been modified and adapted to reproduce the behaviour of the previous starting and make it run on the new grid2op platform.

We are aware some work need to be done to make them more resilient and improve the quality of English. We are working on it at the moment.

This starting kit is mainly composed of 3 jupyter notebook:

- `1_Power_Grid_101_notebook.ipynb` explains the aim of the competition and give a very brief overview about the grid2op platform. For more information about this platform, please refer to the getting_started of grid2op.
- `2_Develop_And_RunLocally_An_agent.ipynb` covers the behavior of the platform on which you need to submit your code. This platform, named Codalab, hosts the competition and computes scores for each participants. This notebook explains briefly how to format an BaseAgent to make a valid submission.
- `3_TestAndFormatYourAgent.ipynb` has for main purpose to perform sanity check before submitting an agent on the Codalab platform. If an BaseAgent fails on this test, there is not need to submit it on Codalab. Remember you have only a limiter number of allowed submissions per day. Don't waste them on failing script.
