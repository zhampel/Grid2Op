"""
This class allows to evaluate a single agent instance on multiple environments running in parrallel.

It uses the python "multiprocessing" framework to work, and thus is suitable only on a single machine with multiple
cores (cpu / thread). We do not recommend to use this method on a cluster of different machines.

This class uses the following representation:

- an :grid2op.BaseAgent.BaseAgent: lives in a main process
- different environment lives into different processes
- a call to :func:`MultiEnv.step` will perform one step per environment, in parallel using a ``Pipe`` to transfer data
  to and from the main process from each individual environment process. It is a synchronous function. It means
  it will wait for every environment to finish the step before returning all the information.

There are some limitations. For example, even if forecast are available, it's not possible to use forecast of the
observations. This imply that :func:`grid2op.BaseObservation.BaseObservation.simulate` is not available when using
:class:`MultiEnvironment`

Compare to regular Environments, :class:`MultiEnvironment` simply stack everything. You need to send not a single
:class:`grid2op.BaseAction.BaseAction` but as many actions as there are underlying environments. You receive not one single
:class:`grid2op.BaseObservation.BaseObservation` but as many observations as the number of underlying environments.

A broader support of regular grid2op environment capabilities as well as support for
:func:`grid2op.BaseObservation.BaseObservation.simulate` call will be added in the future.

An example on how you can best leverage this class is given in the getting_started notebooks. Another simple example is:

.. code-block:: python

    from grid2op.BaseAgent import DoNothingAgent
    from grid2op.MakeEnv import make

    # create a simple environment
    env = make()
    # number of parrallel environment
    nb_env = 2  # change that to adapt to your system
    NB_STEP = 100  # number of step for each environment

    # create a simple agent
    agent = DoNothingAgent(env.action_space)

    # create the multi environment class
    multi_envs = MultiEnvironment(env=env, nb_env=nb_env)

    # making is usable
    obs = multi_envs.reset()
    rews = [env.reward_range[0] for i in range(nb_env)]
    dones = [False for i in range(nb_env)]

    # performs the appropriated steps
    for i in range(NB_STEP):
        acts = [None for _ in range(nb_env)]
        for env_act_id in range(nb_env):
            acts[env_act_id] = agent.act(obs[env_act_id], rews[env_act_id], dones[env_act_id])
        obs, rews, dones, infos = multi_envs.step(acts)

        # DO SOMETHING WITH THE AGENT IF YOU WANT

    # close the environments
    multi_envs.close()
    # close the initial environment
    env.close()
