        It has only minor modifications compared to the original :func:`BaseAction.update` implementation, most notably, it
        doesn't update the :attr:`BaseAction._dict_inj`. It raises a warning if attempting to change them.

        ----------
        dict_: :class:`dict`

            "injection", "change bus", "set bus", or "change line status" are irrelevant for this subclass.

        -------
        self: :class:`PowerLineSet`
            Return object itself thus allowing multiple calls to "update" to be chained.
