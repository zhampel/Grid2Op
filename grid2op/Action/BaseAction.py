"""
The "BaseAction" module lets you define some actions on the underlying power _grid.
These actions are either made by an agent, or by the environment.

For now, the actions can act on:

  - the "injections" and allows you to change:

    - the generators active power production setpoint
    - the generators voltage magnitude setpoint
    - the loads active power consumption
    - the loads reactive power consumption

  - the status of the powerlines (connected/disconnected)
  - the configuration at substations eg setting different objects to different buses for example

The BaseAction class is abstract. You can implement it the way you want. If you decide to extend it, make sure
that the :class:`grid2op.Backend` class will be able to understand it. If you don't, your extension will not affect the
underlying powergrid. Indeed a :class:`grid2op.Backend` will call the :func:`BaseAction.__call__` method and should
understands its return type.

In this module we derived two action class:

  - :class:`BaseAction` represents a type of action that can act on all the above-mentioned objects
  - :class:`TopologyAction` restricts the modification to line status modification and bus reconfiguration at substations.


The :class:`BaseAction` and all its derivatives also offer some usefull inspection utilities:

  - :func:`BaseAction.__str__` prints the action in a format that gives usefull information on how it will affect the powergrid
  - :func:`BaseAction.effect_on` returns a dictionnary that gives information about its effect.

Finally, :class:`BaseAction` class define some strict behavior to follow if reimplementing them. The correctness of each
instances of BaseAction is assessed both when calling :func:`BaseAction.update` or with a call to
:func:`BaseAction._check_for_ambiguity` performed for example by the Backend when it must implement its effect on the
powergrid through a call to :func:`BaseAction.__call__`

class BaseAction(GridObjects):
    """
    This is a base class for each :class:`BaseAction` objects.
    As stated above, an action represents conveniently the modifications that will affect a powergrid.

    It is not recommended to instantiate an action from scratch. The recommended way to get an action is either by
    modifying an existing one using the method :func:`BaseAction.update` or to call and :class:`ActionSpace` object that
    has been properly set up by an :class:`grid2op.Environment`.

    BaseAction can be fully converted to and back from a numpy array with a **fixed** size.

    An action can modify the grid in multiple ways.
    It can change :

    - the production and voltage setpoint of the generator units
    - the amount of power consumed (for both active and reactive part) for load
    - disconnect powerlines
    - change the topology of the _grid.

    To be valid, an action should be convertible to a tuple of 5 elements:

    - the first element is the "injections" vector: representing the way generator units and loads are modified
        - It is, in turn, a dictionary with the following keys (optional)

            - "load_p" a vector of the same size of the load, giving the modification of the loads active consumption
            - "load_q" a vector of the same size of the load, giving the modification of the loads reactive consumption
            - "prod_p" a vector of the same size of the generators, giving the modification of the productions active
              setpoint production
            - "prod_v" a vector of the same size of the generators, giving the modification of the productions voltage
              setpoint

    - the second element is made of force line status. It is made of a vector of size :attr:`BaseAction._n_lines`
      (the number of lines in the powergrid) and is interpreted as:

            - -1 force line disconnection
            - +1 force line reconnection
            - 0 do nothing to this line

    - the third element is the switch line status vector. It is made of a vector of size :attr:`BaseAction._n_lines` and is
      interpreted as:

        - ``True``: change the line status
        - ``False``: don't do anything

    - the fourth element set the buses to which the object is connected. It's a vector of integers with the following
      interpretation:

        - 0 -> don't change
        - 1 -> connect to bus 1
        - 2 -> connect to bus 2
        - -1 -> disconnect the object.

    - the fifth element changes the buses to which the object is connected. It's a boolean vector interpreted as:
        - ``False``: nothing is done
        - ``True``: change the bus eg connect it to bus 1 if it was connected to bus 2 or connect it to bus 2 if it was
          connected to bus 1. NB this is only active if the system has only 2 buses per substation (that's the case for
          the L2RPN challenge).

    - the sixth element is a vector, representing the redispatching. Component of this vector is added to the
      generators active setpoint value (if set) of the first elements.

    **NB** the difference between :attr:`BaseAction._set_topo_vect` and :attr:`BaseAction._change_bus_vect` is the following:

        - If  a component of :attr:`BaseAction._set_topo_vect` is 1, then the object (load, generator or powerline)
          will be moved to bus 1 of the substation to which it is connected. If it is already to bus 1 nothing will be
          done.
          If it's on another bus it will connect it to bus 1. It's disconnected, it will reconnect it and connect it
          to bus 1.
        - If a component of :attr:`BaseAction._change_bus_vect` is True, then the object will be moved from one bus to
          another.
          If the object were on bus 1
          it will be moved on bus 2, and if it were on bus 2, it will be moved on bus 1. If the object were
          disconnected,
          then this does nothing.

    The conversion to the action into an understandable format by the backend is performed by the "update" method,
    that takes into account a dictionary and is responsible to convert it into this format.
    It is possible to overload this class as long as the overloaded :func:`BaseAction.__call__` operator returns the
    specified format, and the :func:`BaseAction.__init__` method has the same signature.

    This format is then digested by the backend and the powergrid is modified accordingly.

    Attributes
    ----------

    _set_line_status: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each powerline, it gives the effect of the action on the status of it. It should be understood as:

          - -1: disconnect the powerline
          - 0: don't affect the powerline
          - +1: reconnect the powerline

    _switch_line_status: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
        For each powerline, it informs whether the action will switch the status of a powerline of not. It should be
        understood as followed:

          - ``False``: the action doesn't affect the powerline
          - ``True``: the action affects the powerline. If it was connected, it will disconnect it. If it was
            disconnected, it will reconnect it.

    _dict_inj: ``dict``
        Represents the modification of the injection (productions and loads) of the power _grid. This dictionary can
        have the optional keys:

            - "load_p" to set the active load values (this is a numpy array with the same size as the number of load
              in the power _grid with Nan: don't change anything, else set the value
            - "load_q": same as above but for the load reactive values
            - "prod_p": same as above but for the generator active setpoint values. It has the size corresponding
              to the number of generators in the test case.
            - "prod_v": same as above but set the voltage setpoint of generator units.

    _set_topo_vect: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        Similar to :attr:`BaseAction._set_line_status` but instead of affecting the status of powerlines, it affects the
        bus connectivity at a substation. It has the same size as the full topological vector (:attr:`BaseAction._dim_topo`)
        and for each element it should be understood as:

            - 0: nothing is changed for this element
            - +1: this element is affected to bus 1
            - -1: this element is affected to bus 2

    _change_bus_vect: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
         Similar to :attr:`BaseAction._switch_line_status` but it affects the topology at substations instead of the status
         of
         the powerline. It has the same size as the full topological vector (:attr:`BaseAction._dim_topo`) and each
         component should mean:

             - ``False``: the object is not affected
             - ``True``: the object will be moved to another bus. If it was on bus 1 it will be moved on bus 2, and if
               it was on bus 2 it will be moved on bus 1.

    authorized_keys: :class:`set`
        The set indicating which keys the actions can understand when calling :func:`BaseAction.update`

    _subs_impacted: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
        This attributes is either not initialized (set to ``None``) or it tells, for each substation, if it is impacted
        by the action (in this case :attr:`BaseAction._subs_impacted`\[sub_id\] is ``True``) or not
        (in this case :attr:`BaseAction._subs_impacted`\[sub_id\] is ``False``)

    _lines_impacted: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
        This attributes is either not initialized (set to ``None``) or it tells, for each powerline, if it is impacted
        by the action (in this case :attr:`BaseAction._lines_impacted`\[line_id\] is ``True``) or not
        (in this case :attr:`BaseAction._subs_impacted`\[line_id\] is ``False``)

    vars_action: ``list``, static
        The authorized key that are processed by :func:`BaseAction.__call__` to modify the injections

    vars_action_set: ``set``, static
        The authorized key that is processed by :func:`BaseAction.__call__` to modify the injections

    _redispatch: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        Amount of redispatching that this action will perform. Redispatching will increase the generator's active
        setpoint
        value. This will be added to the value of the generators. The Environment will make sure that every physical
        constraint is met. This means that the agent provides a setpoint, but there is no guarantee that the setpoint
        will be achievable. Redispatching action is cumulative, this means that if at a given timestep you ask +10 MW
        on a generator, and on another you ask +10 MW then the total setpoint for this generator that the environment
        will try to implement is +20MW.

        Gives information about the element being impacted by this action.

        **NB** The impacted elements can be used by :class:`grid2op.BaseRules` to determine whether or not an action
        is legal or not.

        **NB** The impacted are the elements that can potentially be impacted by the action. This does not mean they
        will be impacted. For examples:

            - If an action from an :class:`grid2op.BaseAgent` reconnect a powerline, but this powerline is being
              disconnected by a hazard at the same time step, then this action will not be implemented on the grid.
              However, it this powerline couldn't be reconnected for some reason (for example it was already out of
              order) the action will still be declared illegal, even if it has NOT impacted the powergrid.
            - If an action tries to disconnect a powerline already disconnected, it will "impact" this powergrid. This
              means that even if the action will do nothing, it disconnecting this powerline is against the
              rules, then the action will be illegal.
            - If an action tries to change the topology of a substation, but this substation is already at the target
              topology, the same mechanism applies. The action will "impact" the substation, even if, in the end, it
              consists of doing nothing.

        Any such "change" that would be illegal is declared as "illegal" regardless of the real impact of this action
        on the powergrid.

              reactive) of the powergrid. It has optionally one of the following keys:

                    - "load_p": to set the active load values (this is a numpy array with the same size as the number of
                      load in the power _grid with Nan: don't change anything, else set the value
                    - "load_q": same as above but for the load reactive values
                    - "prod_p": same as above but for the generator active setpoint values. It has the size
                      corresponding to the number of generators in the test case.
                    - "prod_v": same as above but set the voltage setpoint of generator units.

            - "*hazards*": represents the hazards that the line might suffer (boolean vector) False: no hazard, nothing
              is done, True: a hazard, the powerline is disconnected
            - "*maintenance*": represents the maintenance operation performed on each powerline (boolean vector) False:
              no maintenance, nothing is done, True: a maintenance is scheduled, the powerline is disconnected
            - "*set_line_status*": a vector (int or float) to set the status of the powerline status (connected /
              disconnected) with the following interpretation:

                - 0: nothing is changed,
                - -1: disconnect the powerline,
                - +1: reconnect the powerline. If an action consists in "reconnecting" a powerline, and this same
                  powerline is affected by a maintenance or a hazard, it will be erased without any warning. "hazards"
                  and "maintenance" have the priority.

            - "change_line_status": a vector (bool) to change the status of the powerline. This vector should be
              interpreted as:

                - ``False``: do nothing
                - ``True``: change the status of the powerline: disconnect it if it was connected, connect it if it was
                  disconnected

            - "set_bus": (numpy int vector or dictionary) will set the buses to which the objects are connected. It
              follows a similar interpretation than the line status vector:

                - 0 -> don't change anything
                - +1 -> set to bus 1,
                - +2 -> set to bus 2, etc.
                - -1: You can use this method to disconnect an object by setting the value to -1.

            - "change_bus": (numpy bool vector or dictionary) will change the bus to which the object is connected.
              True will
              change it (eg switch it from bus 1 to bus 2 or from bus 2 to bus 1). NB this is only active if the system
              has only 2 buses per substation.

            - "redispatch" TODO

            **NB** the difference between "set_bus" and "change_bus" is the following:

              - If "set_bus" is 1, then the object (load, generator or powerline) will be moved to bus 1 of the
                substation to which it is connected. If it is already to bus 1 nothing will be done. If it's on another
                bus it will connect it to bus 1. It's disconnected, it will reconnect it and connect it to bus 1.
              - If "change_bus" is True, then objects will be moved from one bus to another. If the object were on bus 1
                then it will be moved on bus 2, and if it were on bus 2, it will be moved on bus 1. If the object is
                disconnected then the action is ambiguous, and calling it will throw an AmbiguousAction exception.

            **NB**: if a powerline is reconnected, it should be specified on the "set_bus" action at which buses it
            should be reconnected. Otherwise, action cannot be used. Trying to apply the action to the grid will
            lead to an "AmbiguousAction" exception.

            **NB**: if for a given powerline, both switch_line_status and set_line_status is set, the action will not
            be usable.
            This will lead to an :class:`grid2op.Exception.AmbiguousAction` exception.

            **NB**: The length of vectors provided here is NOT check in this function. This method can be "chained" and
            only on the final action, when used, eg. in the Backend, is checked.

            **NB**: If a powerline is disconnected, on maintenance, or suffer an outage, the associated "set_bus" will
            be ignored.
            Disconnection has the priority on anything. This priority is given because, in case of hazard, the hazard
            has the priority over the possible actions.

        Examples
        --------
        Here are short examples on how to update an action *eg.* how to create a valid :class:`Action` object that
        be used to modify a :class:`grid2op.Backend.Backend`.

        In all the following examples, we suppose that a valid grid2op environment is created, for example with:
        .. code-block:: python

            import grid2op
            # create a simple environment
            # and make sure every type of action can be used.
            env = grid2op.make(action_class=grid2op.Action.Action)

        *Example 1*: modify the load active values to set them all to 1. You can replace "load_p" by "load_q",
        "prod_p" or "prod_v" to change the load reactive value, the generator active setpoint or the generator
        voltage magnitude setpoint.

        .. code-block:: python

            new_load = np.ones(env.action_space.n_load)
            modify_load_active_value = env.action_space({"injection": {"load_p": new_load}})
            print(modify_load_active_value)

        *Example 2*: disconnect the powerline of id 1:

        .. code-block:: python

            disconnect_powerline = env.action_space({"set_line_status": [(1, -1)]})
            print(disconnect_powerline)
            # there is a shortcut to do that:
            disconnect_powerline2 = env.disconnect_powerline(line_id=1)

        *Example 3*: force the reconnection of the powerline of id 5 by connected it to bus 1 on its origin end and
        bus 2 on its extremity end. Note that this is mandatory to specify on which bus to reconnect each
        extremity of the powerline. Otherwise it's an ambiguous action.

        .. code-block:: python

            reconnect_powerline = env.action_space({"set_line_status": [(5, 1)],
                                                    "set_bus": {"lines_or_id": [(5, 1)]},
                                                    "set_bus": {"lines_ex_id": [(5, 2)]}
                                                     })
            print(reconnect_powerline)
            # and the shorter method:
            reconnect_powerline = env.action.space.reconnect_powerline(line_id=5, bus_or=1, bus_ex=2)

        *Example 4*: change the bus to which load 4 is connected:

        .. code-block:: python

            change_load_bus = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"loads_id": [(4, 1)]} })
            print(change_load_bus)

        *Example 5*: reconfigure completely substation 5, and connect the first 3 elements to bus 1 and the last 3
        elements to bus 2

        .. code-block:: python

            sub_id = 5
            target_topology = np.ones(env.sub_info[sub_id], dtype=np.int)
            target_topology[3:] = 2
            reconfig_sub = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"substations_id": [(sub_id, target_topology)] } })
            print(reconfig_sub)

        This method checks if an action is ambiguous or not. If the instance is ambiguous, an
        :class:`grid2op.Exceptions.AmbiguousAction` is raised.

        An action can be ambiguous in the following context:

          - It incorrectly affects the injections:

            - :code:`self._dict_inj["load_p"]` doesn't have the same size as the number of loads on the _grid.
            - :code:`self._dict_inj["load_q"]` doesn't have the same size as the number of loads on the _grid.
            - :code:`self._dict_inj["prod_p"]` doesn't have the same size as the number of loads on the _grid.
            - :code:`self._dict_inj["prod_v"]` doesn't have the same size as the number of loads on the _grid.

          - It affects the powerline in an incorrect manner:

            - :code:`self._switch_line_status` has not the same size as the number of powerlines
            - :code:`self._set_line_status` has not the same size as the number of powerlines
            - somes lines are reconnected (:code:`self._switch_line_status[i] == True` for some powerline *i* but it is
              not specified on which bus to connect it ( the element corresponding to powerline *i* in
              :code:`self._set_topo_vect` is set to 0)
            - the status of some powerline is both *changed* (:code:`self._switch_line_status[i] == True` for some *i*)
              and *set* (:code:`self._set_line_status[i]` for the same *i* is not 0)

          - It has an ambiguous behavior concerning the topology of some substations

            - the state of some bus for some element is both *changed* (:code:`self._change_bus_vect[i] = True` for
              some *i*) and *set* (:code:`self._set_topo_vect[i]` for the same *i* is not 0)
            - :code:`self._set_topo_vect` has not the same dimension as the number of elements on the powergrid
            - :code:`self._change_bus_vect` has not the same dimension as the number of elements on the powergrid

          - For redispatching, Ambiguous actions can come from:

            - Some redispatching action is active, yet
              :attr:`grid2op.Space.GridObjects.redispatching_unit_commitment_availble` is set to ``False``
            - the length of the redispatching vector :attr:`BaseAction._redispatching` is not compatible with the number
              of generators.
            - some redispatching are above the maximum ramp up :attr:`grid2op.Space.GridObjects.gen_max_ramp_up`
            - some redispatching are below the maximum ramp down :attr:`grid2op.Space.GridObjects.gen_max_ramp_down`
            - the redispatching action affect non dispatchable generators
            - the redispatching and the production setpoint, if added, are above pmax for at least a generator
            - the redispatching and the production setpoint, if added, are below pmin for at least a generator

        In case of need to overload this method, it is advise to still call this one from the base :class:`BaseAction`

          * `prod_p`: if the action modifies the active productions of generators.

            is a dictionary with keys:

              * `nb_changed`: number of powerlines having their status changed
              * `changed_id`: the ids of the powerlines that are changed

          * `change_bus_vect`: if the action tries to **change** the topology of some substations. If present, this
            is a dictionary with keys:

              * `nb_modif_subs`: number of substations impacted by the action
              * `modif_subs_id`: ids of the substations impacted by the action
              * `change_bus_vect`: details the objects that are modified. It is itself a dictionary that represents for
                each impacted substations (keys) the modification of the objects connected to it.

          * `set_bus_vect`: if the action tries to **set** the topology of some substations. If present, this is a
            dictionary with keys:

              * `nb_modif_subs`: number of substations impacted by the action
              * `modif_subs_id`: the ids of the substations impacted by the action
              * `set_bus_vect`: details the objects that are modified. It is also a dictionary that represents for
                each impacted substations (keys) how the elements connected to it are impacted (their "new" bus)

          * `hazards` if the action is composed of some hazards. In this case, it's simply the index of the powerlines
            that are disconnected because of them.
          * `nb_hazards` the number of hazards the "action" implemented (eg number of powerlines disconnected because of
            hazards.
          * `maintenance` if the action is composed of some maintenance. In this case, it's simply the index of the
            powerlines that are affected by maintenance operation at this time step.
            that are disconnected because of them.
          * `nb_maintenance` the number of maintenance the "action" implemented eg the number of powerlines
            disconnected because of maintenance operations.
          * `redispatch` the redispatching action (if any). It gives, for each generator (all generator, not just the
            dispatchable one) the amount of power redispatched in this action.

        """
        Return the effect of this action on a unique given load, generator unit, powerline or substation.
        Only one of load, gen, line or substation should be filled.

        The query of these objects can only be done by id here (ie by giving the integer of the object in the backed).
        The :class:`ActionSpace` has some utilities to access them by name too.

        Parameters
        ----------
        _sentinel: ``None``
            Used to prevent positional parameters. Internal, **do not use**.

        load_id: ``int``
            The ID of the load we want to inspect

        gen_id: ``int``
            The ID of the generator we want to inspect

        line_id: ``int``
            The ID of the powerline we want to inspect

        substation_id: ``int``
            The ID of the substation we want to inspect

        Returns
        -------
        res: :class:`dict`
            A dictionary with keys and value depending on which object needs to be inspected:

            - if a load is inspected, then the keys are:

                - "new_p" the new load active value (or NaN if it doesn't change),
                - "new_q" the new load reactive value (or Nan if nothing has changed from this point of view)
                - "set_bus" the new bus where the load will be moved (int: id of the bus, 0 no change, -1 disconnected)
                - "change_bus" whether or not this load will be moved from one bus to another (for example is an action
                  asked it to go from bus 1 to bus 2)

            - if a generator is inspected, then the keys are:

                - "new_p" the new generator active setpoint value (or NaN if it doesn't change),
                - "new_v" the new generator voltage setpoint value (or Nan if nothing has changed from this point of
                  view)
                - "set_bus" the new bus where the load will be moved (int: id of the bus, 0 no change, -1 disconnected)
                - "change_bus" whether or not this load will be moved from one bus to another (for example is an action
                  asked it to go from bus 1 to bus 2)
                - "redispatch" the amount of power redispatched for this generator.

            - if a powerline is inspected then the keys are:

                - "change_bus_or": whether or not the origin end will be moved from one bus to another
                - "change_bus_ex": whether or not the extremity end will be moved from one bus to another
                - "set_bus_or": the new bus where the origin will be moved
                - "set_bus_ex": the new bus where the extremity will be moved
                - "set_line_status": the new status of the power line
                - "change_line_status": whether or not to switch the status of the powerline

            - if a substation is inspected, it returns the topology to this substation in a dictionary with keys:

                - "change_bus"
                - "set_bus"

        NB the difference between "set_bus" and "change_bus" is the following:

            - If "set_bus" is 1, then the object (load, generator or powerline) will be moved to bus 1 of the substation
              to which it is connected. If it is already to bus 1 nothing will be done. If it's on another bus it will
              connect it to bus 1. It's disconnected, it will reconnect it and connect it to bus 1.
            - If "change_bus" is True, then the object will be moved from one bus to another. If the object were on bus 1
              then it will be moved on bus 2, and if it were on bus 2, it will be moved on bus 1. If the object were
              disconnected, then it will be connected to the affected bus.
