class IdToAct(Converter):
    """
    This type of converter allows to represent action with unique id. Instead of manipulating complex objects, it allows
    to manipulate only positive integer.

    The list of all actions can either be the list of all possible unary actions (see below for a complete
    description) or by a given pre computed list.

    A "unary action" is an action that consists only in acting on one "concept" it includes:

    - disconnecting a single powerline
    - reconnecting a single powerline and connect it to bus xxx on its origin end and yyy on its extremity end
    - changing the topology of a single substation

    Examples of non unary actions include:
    - disconnection / reconnection of 2 or more powerlines
    - change of the configuration of 2 or more substations
    - disconnection / reconnection of a single powerline and change of the configration of a single substation

    **NB** All the actions created automatically are unary. For the L2RPN 2019, agent could be allowed to act with non
    unary actions, for example by disconnecting a powerline and reconfiguring a substation. This class would not
    allow to do such action at one time step.

    **NB** The actions that are initialized by default uses the "set" way and not the "change" way (see the description
    of :class:`grid2op.BaseAction.BaseAction` for more information).

    For each powerline, 5 different actions will be computed:

    - disconnect it
    - reconnect it and connect it to bus 1 on "origin" end ann bus 1 on "extremity" end
    - reconnect it and connect it to bus 1 on "origin" end ann bus 2 on "extremity" end
    - reconnect it and connect it to bus 2 on "origin" end ann bus 1 on "extremity" end
    - reconnect it and connect it to bus 2 on "origin" end ann bus 2 on "extremity" end

    Actions corresponding to all topologies are also used by default. See
    :func:`grid2op.BaseAction.ActionSpace.get_all_unitary_topologies_set` for more information.


    In this converter:

    - `encoded_act` are positive integer, representing the index of the actions.
    - `transformed_obs` are regular observations.

        ----------
        all_actions: ``list``
            The (ordered) list of all actions that the agent will be able to perform. If given a number ``i`` the
            converter will return action ``all_actions[i]``. In the "pacman" game, this vector could be
            ["up", "down", "left", "right"], in this case "up" would be encode by 0, "down" by 1, "left" by 2 and
            "right" by 3. If nothing is provided, the converter will output all the unary actions possible for
            the environment. Be careful, computing all these actions might take some time.
