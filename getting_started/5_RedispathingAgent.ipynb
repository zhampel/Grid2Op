In next challenges, or for other usage of this platform where redispatching plays a role, it's better to consider the economic cost of the sytem. However, usually the cost is minimized, while the reward is maximized. To take this into account, a simplistic reward named \"EconomicReward\" has been created. It has the following property:\n",

Also, note that the redispatching is implemented in \"delta\" it means you need first to provide an economic dispatch, and then you reason in terms of variation compare to it. This is the usage explained in this notebook. For real unit commitment / economic dispatch problem the key words \"injections\" / \"prod_p\" in the action would probably be much suited."

    "- it is not possible, for the same physical limitations to increase (or decrease) too much the value between two consecutive time steps.\n",
    "- redispatching actions stack with one another. It means if you ask to augment the production of generator 1 of $10MW$ at time step t, and of $20MW$ at time step $t+1$, it means the set point at time step $t+1$ will be $+30MW$ at this time step compared to a sate where no redispatching is made (it would have been of $+10MW$ if the second redispatching action were not performed).\n",

    "Having said this, a lot of thing can happen, that makes redispatching a bit less trivial than topology:\n",

The setpoint of this generator at time t is $60MW$, and you want to increase its value of $40MW$. This action is legal: $60+40 \\leq pmax (=100) $. So at time $t$ everything is fine. Now let's suppose the environment also moved the setpoint of this same generator from $60$ to be at $70MW$ at time $t+1$. With the redispatching action, this would mean the setpoint asked is $70+40 = 110 > pmax$. This is not possible. In this case, the redispatching action will be capped. Among the desired redispatching of $+40$, only $+30$ will be implemented on the powergrid. \n",
    "- Another problem can arise with the fundamental principle of power grid: power energy cannot be stored on a grid. At each time we then have $\\sum \\text{Prod} = \\sum \\text{Load} + \\text{Losses}$. In this competition, the data are generated such that this condition holds (approximately) for all time steps. This means that if you ask a redispatching of +xxx MW on a given generator, then the other one must compensate and \"absorb\" xxx MW such that it sums at 0 overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of simplicity for the participants, there are some \"automaton\" that automatically transform an proposed redispatching action into a valid redispatching action. These automatons basically ensure that the two above-mentionned conditions hold. It explains the differences between \"target_redispatching\" which is the setpoint enter by the agent, and the \"actual_redispatching\" which what has been implemented on the powergrid after these automatons work."
